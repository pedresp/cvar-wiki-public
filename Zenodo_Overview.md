# Zenodo 

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is an open repository developed under the European OpenAIRE project and 
managed by CERN. In it, researchers can publish various types of information such as 
software, data used in research, publications, and other materials. 
Zenodo aims to promote Open Science by making it easier for research to be reproduced 
under the same conditions in which it was conducted. To that end, it provides several 
mechanisms to ensure proper preservation and access. 

## Features 
Following the FAIR principles, Zenodo assigns a DOI to each submission so it can be 
uniquely identified and the content easily discoverable and citable. The given DOI is 
top-level and supports multiple versions of the submission. Another positive aspect is 
the metadata associated with each submission; this must include information about 
authors, the nature of the submission, permitted uses, funding, references, etc. 
Additionally, content published on Zenodo can be used from the moment it is published 
and DOI reservation occurs within seconds. 

In support of open science and reproducibility, **data uploaded** to Zenodo **cannot be deleted** in the normal workflow. Withdrawal or removal of a record is considered an 
exceptional action and results in a tombstone page being retained for citation purposes, 
so one must be careful about what is published on the platform. However, the metadata 
associated with a submission can be modified after publication.

Because of the platform’s open nature, uploaded content is public by default. However, 
since there may be sensitive data or work not yet published, Zenodo allows uploads to be 
restricted or embargoed. Restricted submissions protect access; a third party who wants 
access must fill out a form providing personal information and the reason for access. For 
embargoed submissions, the content becomes accessible only after a specified date; until 
then it remains restricted. 
Finally, Zenodo offers a wide range of licenses for submissions to its repository. 

## Creating an account

Zenodo offers several sign-in option. Users may link a newly created account to an 
existing ORCID or GitHub account, or create a local account using an email address, 
preferably an institutional one. A detailed tutorial is available at
https://help.zenodo.org/docs/get-started/create-an-account/.

## Uploading Content 
Publishing on Zenodo is intuitive and quick and only requires an account. The process 
begins by clicking the “New upload” button on the homepage after signing in. A panel 
appears where you upload the files and then complete the associated metadata. In this 
section you will be asked whether the content needs a DOI; if a DOI already exists for the 
material, it is recommended not to request a new one to avoid duplicates. While filling out 
metadata, you should change the visibility if you want the content to be private or under 
embargo. 
  
Lastly, it is crucial to know that once data is uploaded to the repository, it cannot be 
removed. A tutorial with images and steps for publishing on Zenodo is available at
